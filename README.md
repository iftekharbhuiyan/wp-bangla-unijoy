# WordPress Bangla Unijoy Keyboard
This script on functions.php page allows users to use and incorporate "unijoy" keyboard layout from WordPress admin panel (Page/Post). In order to make this script working, unijoy.js must be located within the "js" folder inside the active/current theme.

Note: This script works with Classic Editor only. However, it can be incorporated with Gutenberg as well.
